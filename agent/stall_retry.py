"""
Agentic stall-retry (dflash Q4 premature-EOS workaround).

dflash (Qwen3.6-27B Q4_K_M, lucebox spec-decode) sometimes emits EOS right
after a short action preamble ("Let me check X:") on agentic decision turns,
ending the turn with NO tool_call -> the agent loop treats it as a final
answer and stops mid-task. Higher-precision weights (the stock Q6 lane on the
same host) continue to a real tool call on the identical prompt.

This module detects that stall signature on a no-tool-call turn and retries
the SAME turn once against a higher-quality model lane. If the retry produces
tool_calls, the loop adopts that response and continues; otherwise the caller
should fail the turn as partial rather than persist the planning-only text as
a final assistant message.

Entirely opt-in: does nothing unless ``HERMES_STALL_RETRY_MODEL`` is set
(e.g. ``qwen3.6-27b-256k``). Default-off => zero change to existing behavior.

Env:
  HERMES_STALL_RETRY_MODEL  retry lane/model name (required to enable)
  HERMES_STALL_RETRY_MAX_CHARS  max content length to still count as a stall
                                (default 400; real final answers are longer)
