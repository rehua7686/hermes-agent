# Multi-arch Hermes image: linux/amd64, linux/arm64, linux/riscv64.
#
# amd64/arm64 are UNCHANGED from before: uv and Node are copied from the
# upstream images. riscv64 has no manifest for those images and no manylinux
# riscv64 wheels for the native Python deps, so it takes alternate paths gated
# on TARGETARCH, each marked `# riscv64:`:
#   - uv and Node come from checksum-pinned riscv64 tarballs, selected via the
#     `FROM <name>_${TARGETARCH}` per-arch-stage pattern below. BuildKit prunes
#     the unreferenced (image-based) stages, so the riscv64-less uv/node images
#     are never pulled on a riscv64 build.
#   - a rustup toolchain + a few build deps are added so uv compiles the native
#     wheels from sdist (no-op on amd64/arm64, which use prebuilt wheels).
#   - npm uses `npm ci` (npm 10.9.x `npm install` crashes reconciling optional
#     deps on a platform absent from the lockfile), and Playwright is skipped
#     (no riscv64 Chromium).
#   - the web dashboard (Tailwind v4 -> lightningcss + @tailwindcss/oxide, no
#     riscv64 napi binary) is built on the BUILD host by CI and injected via
#     the build context; only the TUI builds in-image on riscv64. See the
#     docker-publish.yml change that ships with this.

# TARGETARCH must be declared before the FROM stages that interpolate it.

# architecture-independent and reused as-is.
#
# We use `curl` instead of `ADD` for the per-arch tarball because `ADD`
# evaluates its URL at parse time, before any ARG / TARGETARCH substitution
# — splitting one URL per arch into multiple ADDs would download them all on
# every build and leave dead bytes in the cache. A single curl + arch-keyed
# URL is simpler and cache-friendlier.
#
# Supply-chain integrity: every tarball is checksum-verified against the
# upstream-published SHA256. To bump S6_OVERLAY_VERSION, fetch the per-arch
# `.sha256` files from the corresponding release and update the ARGs. The
# checksum lookup happens during build, so a compromised release artifact
# fails the build loudly instead of silently producing a tampered image.

# that would pull in `[rl]` (atroposlib + tinker + torch + wandb from
# git), `[yc-bench]` (another git dep), and `[termux-all]` (Android
# redundancy), none of which belong in the published container.
#
# Provider packages (anthropic, bedrock, azure-identity) are included
# so Docker users can use these providers without requiring runtime
# lazy-install access to PyPI (often blocked in containerized envs).
#
# The hindsight memory provider's client (hindsight-client) is baked in
# for the same reason: it lazy-installs into /opt/hermes/.venv at first
# use, which lives inside the (immutable) image layer rather than the
# mounted /opt/data volume, so it is lost on every container recreate /
# image update and recall/retain then fails with

# only (HERMES_WEB_DIST points at hermes_cli/web_dist) and is intentionally
# not chowned here.
# /opt/hermes/gateway is runtime-writable: Python may create __pycache__ and
# gateway state artifacts beneath the package after services drop privileges,
# especially when the hermes UID is remapped at boot (#27221).
# The .venv MUST remain hermes-writable so lazy_deps.py can install
# remaining optional platform packages and future pin bumps at first use.
# Without this, `uv pip install` fails with EACCES and adapters silently

# Point the TUI launcher at the prebuilt bundle baked at build time (Layer 8:
# `ui-tui && npm run build`). This makes _make_tui_argv take the prebuilt-bundle
# fast path (`node --expose-gc /opt/hermes/ui-tui/dist/entry.js`) and skip the
# _tui_need_npm_install / runtime `npm install` branch entirely — exactly the
# nix/packaged-release path the launcher was designed for.
#
# Why this is required (not just an optimization): the root package-lock.json
# describes the WHOLE monorepo workspace set (root + web + ui-tui + apps/*),
# but the image only installs root/web/ui-tui (apps/* — the desktop app — is
# never `npm install`ed here). So the actualized node_modules permanently
# disagrees with the canonical lock, _tui_need_npm_install() returns True on
# every launch, and the runtime `npm install` it triggers (a) can never
# converge against the partial monorepo and (b) races itself across concurrent
# embedded-chat (/api/pty) connections → ENOTEMPTY → the chat tab dies with a
# 502 / "[session ended]". Pointing at the prebuilt bundle sidesteps the whole
# check. (A separate launcher hardening is tracked independently.)

# `docker exec` privilege-drop shim. When operators run
# `docker exec <c> hermes ...` they default to root, and any file the
# command writes under $HERMES_HOME (auth.json, .env, config.yaml) ends
# up root-owned and unreadable to the supervised gateway (UID 10000).
# The shim lives at /opt/hermes/bin/hermes, sits earliest on PATH, and
# transparently re-exec's the real venv binary via `s6-setuidgid hermes`
# when invoked as root. Non-root callers (supervised processes,
# `--user hermes`, etc.) hit the short-circuit path with no overhead.
# Recursion is impossible because the shim exec's the venv binary by
# absolute path (/opt/hermes/.venv/bin/hermes). See the shim source for
# the opt-out env var (HERMES_DOCKER_EXEC_AS_ROOT=1).

# Pre-s6 entrypoint.sh did `source .venv/bin/activate` which exported
# the venv bin onto PATH; Architecture B's main-wrapper.sh does the
# same for the container's main process, but `docker exec` and our
# cont-init.d scripts don't pass through the wrapper. Expose the venv
# bin globally so `docker exec <container> hermes ...` and any
# subprocess that doesn't activate the venv first still find hermes.
#
# /opt/hermes/bin is prepended ahead of the venv so the privilege-drop
# shim wins PATH resolution. The shim's last act is to exec the venv
# binary by absolute path, so this PATH ordering is transparent to
# every other consumer.

# s6-overlay's /init is PID 1. It sets up the supervision tree, runs
# /etc/cont-init.d/* (our stage2 hook), starts s6-rc services
# declared in /etc/s6-overlay/s6-rc.d/, then exec's its remaining
# argv as the container's "main program" with stdin/stdout/stderr
# inherited (this is what makes interactive --tui work). When the
# main program exits, /init begins stage 3 shutdown and the container
# exits with the program's exit code. Replaces tini — see Phase 2 of
# docs/plans/2026-05-07-s6-overlay-dynamic-subagent-gateways.md.
#
# We use the ENTRYPOINT+CMD split rather than CMD alone so the
# wrapper is prepended to user-supplied args automatically:
#
#   docker run <image>                  → /init main-wrapper.sh   (CMD default)
#   docker run <image> chat -q "hi"     → /init main-wrapper.sh chat -q hi
#   docker run <image> sleep infinity   → /init main-wrapper.sh sleep infinity
#   docker run <image> --tui            → /init main-wrapper.sh --tui
#
# main-wrapper.sh handles arg routing (bare-exec vs. hermes
# subcommand vs. no-args), drops to the hermes user via s6-setuidgid,
# and exec's the final program so its exit code becomes the container
# exit code. Without the wrapper-as-ENTRYPOINT, leading-dash args
# like `--version` would be intercepted by /init's POSIX shell.
