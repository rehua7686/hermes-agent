# Fluxer

[Fluxer](https://fluxer.app/) is a free, open-source Discord-like chat platform with channels, DMs, rich Markdown, reactions, files, and voice/video chat. Hermes talks to Fluxer through the bot REST API for outbound messages and the Fluxer Gateway WebSocket for inbound events.

Fluxer is a good fit when you want a self-hostable, chat-first surface for Hermes with Discord-style UX but without depending on Discord. The hosted web app also ships as an installable PWA (`display: standalone` in the web manifest), so privacy-oriented users can get an app-like mobile experience today while native mobile apps continue to mature.

> Run `hermes gateway setup` and pick **Fluxer** for a guided setup when the plugin is installed.

## Why Fluxer is interesting for Hermes

Fluxer is not just “another Discord target.” A few platform traits make it especially attractive for Hermes users:

- **Open source and self-hostable** — Fluxer is AGPL-3.0 and documents self-hosted deployments. That gives privacy-oriented users a path to keep their community/chat infrastructure under their own control.
- **Installable web app today** — the web client exposes a PWA manifest and can run in a standalone app-like window on mobile/desktop browsers; native mobile clients are still described as coming.
- **Discord-like community model** — guilds, channels, DMs/group DMs, roles, permissions, audit logs, invites, pins, reactions, webhooks, custom emoji/stickers, and message search are first-class Fluxer concepts.
- **Strong media/voice foundation** — Fluxer exposes attachments, media proxying, voice/video/call APIs, RTC regions, screen-sharing UX, and entrance sounds. Hermes currently uses the message/media layer, while live call participation is intentionally out of scope for this text gateway adapter.
- **Automation-friendly APIs** — Fluxer has bot tokens, OAuth2 applications, channel/guild webhooks, GitHub/Slack-compatible webhook endpoints, scheduled messages, read states, and gateway events. The Hermes plugin only implements the pieces needed for safe agent chat, but the platform has room for future deeper automations.

## What works

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| Text chat | ✅ | DMs and channels |
| Markdown | ✅ | Hermes sends normal Markdown; Fluxer renders the supported subset |
| Images/files | ✅ | Uploads use Fluxer's multipart message endpoint |
| Audio / voice files | ✅ | Works when the Fluxer deployment exposes file/voice-message support |
| Typing indicator | ✅ | Refreshed while Hermes is working |
| Message edits | ✅ | Used for progress/stream-style updates where Hermes edits a sent message |
| Message deletes | ✅ | Gateway cleanup and deleted approval prompts are handled |
| Reactions | ✅ | Hermes uses Fluxer message reactions for dangerous-command approvals (`✅`, `🕒`, `♾️`, `❌`) because the hosted public message API does not currently expose message components. |
| Buttons/components | Deployment-dependent | Fluxer's hosted public message API currently does not list a `components` field, so Hermes does not rely on buttons. Approval prompts use reactions plus slash-command text fallback. |
| Native slash commands | Deployment-dependent | Hermes can translate Fluxer `APPLICATION_COMMAND` interactions if a deployment emits them, but the current hosted API spec does not expose application-command registration routes. Keep `FLUXER_REGISTER_NATIVE_COMMANDS=false` unless your deployment provides those routes. |
| Message pins | ✅ | Uses Fluxer's `/channels/{id}/messages/pins` routes when the server enables pins |
| Threads | — | Hosted Fluxer currently exposes reply references, but not Discord-style thread routes in the public API spec. Hermes keeps speculative helpers for deployments that add thread endpoints, but the platform-comparison table does not count this as end-to-end thread support. |
| Channel directory | ✅ | Lists guild channels, forums when exposed, and session-discovered DMs/known channels |
| Backlog recovery | ✅ | Recent messages in known channels are scanned after startup/reconnect |

## Prerequisites

- A Fluxer bot token in the form `<applicationId>.<secret>`
- The channel or DM ID where Hermes should live
- Optional but recommended: the Fluxer user IDs allowed to talk to the bot

The hosted API defaults to:

```text
https://api.fluxer.app/v1
```

Self-hosted deployments can override the API base with `FLUXER_BASE_URL`.

## Configure Hermes

### Via setup wizard

```bash
hermes gateway setup
```

Select **Fluxer** and follow the prompts.

### Via environment variables

Add these to `~/.hermes/.env`:

```bash
FLUXER_BOT_TOKEN=app_id.secret
FLUXER_HOME_CHANNEL=123456789012345678
FLUXER_ALLOWED_USERS=123456789012345678
```

Then restart the gateway:

```bash
hermes gateway restart
```

For a self-hosted Fluxer instance:

```bash
FLUXER_BASE_URL=https://fluxer.example.com
```

If you already know the WebSocket gateway URL and want to skip discovery:

```bash
FLUXER_GATEWAY_URL=wss://fluxer.example.com/gateway
```

Normally Hermes discovers this from `GET /gateway/bot`.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---:|---|
| `FLUXER_BOT_TOKEN` | Yes | Bot token, usually `<applicationId>.<secret>` |
| `FLUXER_BASE_URL` | Optional | REST API base URL. Defaults to `https://api.fluxer.app/v1`. Plain self-hosted origins are normalized to `/api`. |
| `FLUXER_GATEWAY_URL` | Optional | Override Gateway WebSocket URL. Normally discovered via `/gateway/bot`. |
| `FLUXER_HOME_CHANNEL` | Recommended | Default channel/DM for cron delivery and notifications. Also treated as a free-response channel. |
| `FLUXER_HOME_CHANNEL_NAME` | Optional | Human label for the home channel. |
| `FLUXER_ALLOWED_USERS` | Recommended | Comma-separated Fluxer user IDs allowed to talk to Hermes. |
| `FLUXER_ALLOW_ALL_USERS` | Optional | Allow every Fluxer user. Only safe for private/dev deployments. Default: `false`. |
| `FLUXER_ALLOWED_CHANNELS` | Optional | Comma-separated channel IDs where Hermes may respond. Empty means no channel whitelist. DMs are still governed by user authorization. |
| `FLUXER_FREE_RESPONSE_CHANNELS` | Optional | Comma-separated channel IDs where Hermes responds without being mentioned. |
| `FLUXER_HOME_GUILD_ID` / `FLUXER_HOME_GUILDS` | Optional | Guild/community IDs that represent the user's own Hermes workspace. |
| `FLUXER_AUTO_FREE_RESPONSE_HOME_GUILD` | Optional | When `true`, channels inside configured home guilds are conversational without per-channel opt-in. Default: `false`. |
| `FLUXER_MENTION_GATED_CHANNELS` | Optional | Comma-separated channel IDs that still require a mention even inside auto-free-response home guilds. |
| `FLUXER_REQUIRE_MENTION` | Optional | Require a direct mention/address in non-home channels. Default: `true`. |
| `FLUXER_STRICT_MENTION` | Optional | Require a fresh mention on every channel message instead of remembering mentioned threads. Default: `false`. |
| `FLUXER_MENTION_PATTERNS` | Optional | Comma-separated regexes that count as direct addresses. Defaults already cover `Hermes` at the start of a message. |
| `FLUXER_REGISTER_NATIVE_COMMANDS` | Optional | Register Hermes slash commands with Fluxer on gateway connect. Default: `false` so deployments can opt in deliberately. |
| `FLUXER_APPLICATION_ID` | Optional | Fluxer application ID for native command registration. If omitted, Hermes uses the token prefix before the first `.`. |
| `FLUXER_NATIVE_COMMAND_GUILDS` | Optional | Comma-separated guild IDs for guild-scoped command registration. Empty means global application commands. |
| `FLUXER_BACKLOG_RECOVERY` | Optional | Recover recent messages from known channels after startup/reconnect. Default: `true`. |
| `FLUXER_BACKLOG_LIMIT` | Optional | Max recent messages to scan per known channel. Default: `25`, capped at `100`. |
| `FLUXER_BACKLOG_BOOTSTRAP_SECONDS` | Optional | Startup lookback window when no previous disconnect time exists. Default: `120`, capped at `900`. |
| `FLUXER_DELIVERY_VERIFICATION` | Optional | Read back sent/edited messages to verify visible delivery. Default: `true`. |
| `FLUXER_ALLOW_MENTION_EVERYONE` | Optional | Permit outbound `@everyone` / `@here`. Default: `false`; Hermes neutralizes them. |
| `FLUXER_ALLOW_MENTION_ROLES` | Optional | Permit outbound role mentions like `<@&...>`. Default: `false`; Hermes neutralizes them. |
| `FLUXER_ALLOW_MENTION_USERS` | Optional | Permit outbound user mentions. Default: `true`. |
| `FLUXER_ALLOW_MENTION_REPLIED_USER` | Optional | Permit reply notifications to the replied-to user when Fluxer supports `allowed_mentions`. Default: `true`. |

## Authorization and channel behavior

Fluxer uses the normal Hermes gateway authorization model:

```bash
FLUXER_ALLOWED_USERS=123456789012345678,234567890123456789
```

For development-only private deployments, you can allow everyone:

```bash
FLUXER_ALLOW_ALL_USERS=true
```

Do not use `FLUXER_ALLOW_ALL_USERS=true` on a public or shared server if Hermes has terminal/tool access.

Channel behavior is intentionally quiet by default:

- DMs are processed when the user is authorized.
- `FLUXER_HOME_CHANNEL` is processed without a mention, so your main Hermes room feels natural.
- Other channels require a direct mention/address by default.
- Casual mentions in the middle of a conversation do not wake the bot.

Examples:

```text
Hermes, check this please     # accepted
@Hermes summarize the thread  # accepted
I think Hermes said that      # ignored in channels
```

Set `FLUXER_FREE_RESPONSE_CHANNELS` for additional channels where Hermes should always respond. Use this for dedicated bot/project rooms (for example weatherbot, trading, or other automation channels) where every message is effectively part of the conversation. Leave ordinary shared/social channels mention-gated so a passing “Hermes said…” does not wake the bot.

For a personal Hermes-owned Fluxer community, set `FLUXER_HOME_GUILD_ID` (or `FLUXER_HOME_GUILDS`) plus `FLUXER_AUTO_FREE_RESPONSE_HOME_GUILD=true`. New channels created inside those home guilds then work like conversational bot rooms without editing `FLUXER_FREE_RESPONSE_CHANNELS` every time. Use `FLUXER_MENTION_GATED_CHANNELS` to opt noisy rooms such as logs or notification feeds back into mention-only mode.

## Native interactions

Hermes keeps Fluxer native-interaction support guarded and deployment-aware:

- if a Fluxer deployment accepts `components`, Hermes also attaches action rows/buttons for dangerous-command approvals and slash confirmations;
- dangerous-command approval prompts include visible text fallback commands (`/approve once`, `/approve session`, `/approve always`, `/deny`) so hosted/client builds that do not render components remain usable;
- if a deployment emits `INTERACTION_CREATE` with `type=3` / `MESSAGE_COMPONENT`, Hermes resolves the matching pending action;
- if a deployment emits `INTERACTION_CREATE` with `type=2` / `APPLICATION_COMMAND`, Hermes translates it into normal slash text such as `/model gpt-5.5`.

Native command registration is opt-in and should only be enabled for deployments that expose the required application-command routes:

```bash
FLUXER_REGISTER_NATIVE_COMMANDS=true
FLUXER_APPLICATION_ID=app_id   # optional when FLUXER_BOT_TOKEN is app_id.secret
```

For fast guild-scoped registration during testing on compatible deployments:

```bash
FLUXER_REGISTER_NATIVE_COMMANDS=true
FLUXER_NATIVE_COMMAND_GUILDS=123456789012345678,234567890123456789
```

## Dangerous-command approvals

On deployments with component support, Hermes can also attach native dangerous-command approval buttons:

| Button | Text fallback | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Allow once | `/approve once` | approve only the waiting command |
| Session | `/approve session` | allow matching commands for this session |
| Always | `/approve always` | persist the approval pattern |
| Deny | `/deny` | deny |

Hermes always includes the text fallback in Fluxer approval prompts because hosted/client builds may accept the message while not rendering component buttons. Emoji reactions are not approval controls. If the approval prompt is deleted before it is resolved, Hermes fails closed and denies the pending approval.

## Media, voice, and streaming

Hermes can send images, videos, documents, audio files, and voice-message-shaped audio through Fluxer's multipart message API. Inbound attachments are cached and passed to the agent as media URLs/types.

Voice/audio support depends on the Fluxer deployment exposing the relevant file and voice-message fields. If a deployment only supports plain files, audio may appear as a normal file instead of a voice bubble.

Hermes streaming on Fluxer is edit-based: the gateway sends or reuses a progress bubble, then updates it with `PATCH /channels/{channel_id}/messages/{message_id}`. The hosted API accepts message edits, so Fluxer counts as supporting Hermes-style streaming/progress updates even though it is not a token-by-token websocket stream to the client.

## Pins, replies, and channel directory

Hermes includes Fluxer pin helpers for deployments that expose pin routes:

```text
GET    /channels/{channel_id}/messages/pins
PUT    /channels/{channel_id}/pins/{message_id}
DELETE /channels/{channel_id}/pins/{message_id}
```

The hosted Fluxer API has been verified to list pins with `GET /channels/{id}/messages/pins` and documents pin/unpin via `/channels/{id}/pins/{message_id}`.

Fluxer hosted API supports Discord-like reply references via `message_reference`; Hermes uses those for reply context and referenced-message lookup.

The adapter also keeps guarded helpers for deployments that add Discord-style thread endpoints, but the current hosted public API spec does not expose those routes. Do not rely on thread creation or active-thread enumeration unless your Fluxer deployment documents the routes.

`send_message(action="list")` includes Fluxer guild channels, forums when exposed, and known/session-discovered DMs/channels when the deployment exposes `/users/@me/guilds` and `/guilds/{guild_id}/channels`. Channel gateway events update the adapter's known-channel set, so reconnect backlog recovery can include newly revealed channels.

## Backlog recovery

The Gateway WebSocket is the primary inbound path. On startup or reconnect, Hermes also scans recent messages from known channels so short outages do not silently drop messages.

Known channels include:

- `FLUXER_HOME_CHANNEL`
- `home_channel` from config
- channels the adapter has sent to or received from during the current process

Backlog recovery is conservative:

- It only scans a bounded number of messages.
- It ignores messages older than the reconnect/startup cutoff.
- It dedupes by message ID.
- It still filters self-messages, unauthorized users, and channel mention-gating.

Disable it if your Fluxer deployment cannot list channel messages:

```bash
FLUXER_BACKLOG_RECOVERY=false
```

## Cron and `send_message`

With `FLUXER_HOME_CHANNEL` set, cron jobs can deliver to Fluxer:

```python
cronjob(
    action="create",
    schedule="0 9 * * *",
    deliver="fluxer",
    prompt="Send a short morning status."
)
```

Or send explicitly:

```python
send_message(target="fluxer:123456789012345678", message="Done.")
```

The plugin registers a standalone sender, so cron delivery also works when the cron runner is not the live gateway process.

## Troubleshooting

**Gateway says Fluxer is not configured** — Check `FLUXER_BOT_TOKEN`. `FLUXER_BASE_URL` is optional; the hosted API is the default.

**Connect fails with gateway URL missing** — Hermes could not fetch a usable URL from `/gateway/bot`. Set `FLUXER_GATEWAY_URL` explicitly and restart the gateway.

**Messages send but don't appear** — Keep `FLUXER_DELIVERY_VERIFICATION=true` and check gateway logs. Hermes reads the sent message back when possible and logs delivery mismatch warnings.

**The bot answers in channels where it should stay quiet** — Check `FLUXER_HOME_CHANNEL`, `FLUXER_FREE_RESPONSE_CHANNELS`, `FLUXER_AUTO_FREE_RESPONSE_HOME_GUILD`, and `FLUXER_REQUIRE_MENTION`. The home channel and configured home-guild channels are intentionally free-response. Add noisy channel IDs to `FLUXER_MENTION_GATED_CHANNELS` to opt them out of home-guild auto-response.

**The bot ignores channel messages** — In non-home channels, address it directly (`Hermes, ...` or a real bot mention), add the channel to `FLUXER_FREE_RESPONSE_CHANNELS`, configure `FLUXER_HOME_GUILD_ID` with `FLUXER_AUTO_FREE_RESPONSE_HOME_GUILD=true`, or set `FLUXER_REQUIRE_MENTION=false`.

**Dangerous-command approval text fallback is needed** — Some Fluxer hosted/client builds accept component payloads but do not render buttons. Use `/approve once`, `/approve session`, `/approve always`, or `/deny` from the prompt text. If buttons are visible, they are optional shortcuts.

**Reconnects / heartbeat warnings** — The adapter responds to server heartbeat requests and sends regular heartbeats. Fresh `4009 Heartbeat timeout` warnings usually mean the deployment closed the WebSocket before the bot could identify/heartbeat; check network path, `FLUXER_GATEWAY_URL`, and server logs.
