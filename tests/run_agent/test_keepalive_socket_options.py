"""Regression coverage for #28834 — first tool call after a 2-3 minute
idle pause freezes at "[Calling tool: ...]" because the provider
socket has silently zombified and neither the macOS TCP keepalive
budget nor the httpx pool retried fast enough to recover.

The fix has two halves, both inside
``AIAgent._build_keepalive_http_client``:

* set ``TCP_KEEPINTVL`` / ``TCP_KEEPCNT`` on **both** the Linux and
  macOS branches so the dead-peer detection budget is bounded at
  ~60 s on both platforms (was ~10 min on macOS)
* pass ``retries=1`` to ``httpx.HTTPTransport`` so a stale-pool
  connection that beats the keepalive timer triggers a single
  transparent re-dial instead of bubbling up as a freeze

These tests pin both halves at the socket-option / transport level
so neither half can silently regress.
