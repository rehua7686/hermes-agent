"""Tests for hermes_bootstrap — Windows UTF-8 stdio shim.

The bootstrap module is imported at the top of every Hermes entry point
(hermes, hermes-agent, hermes-acp, gateway, batch_runner, cli.py).  It
fixes Python's Windows UTF-8 defaults so print("café") doesn't crash and
subprocess children inherit UTF-8 mode.

Key invariants covered by these tests:

  1. Windows: env vars get set, stdio reconfigured, non-ASCII print works
  2. POSIX: complete no-op (we don't touch LANG/LC_* or anything else)
  3. Idempotent: safe to call multiple times
  4. Respects user opt-out: if the user explicitly sets PYTHONUTF8=0 or
     PYTHONIOENCODING=something-else, we leave those alone
  5. Load order: every Hermes entry point imports hermes_bootstrap as its
     first non-docstring import (before anything that might do file I/O
     or print to stdout)
