"""Tests for the WAL→DELETE journal-mode fallback on NFS / SMB / FUSE.

When ``PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL`` raises ``OperationalError("locking protocol")``
(SQLITE_PROTOCOL — typical on NFS/SMB), Hermes must fall back to
``journal_mode=DELETE`` so ``state.db`` / ``kanban.db`` remain usable.

Without this fallback, users on NFS-mounted ``HERMES_HOME`` silently lose
``/resume``, ``/title``, ``/history``, ``/branch``, session search, and the
kanban dispatcher — because ``SessionDB()`` init propagates the error and
every caller swallows it, leaving ``_session_db = None``.

See: https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html — "WAL does not work over a network
filesystem".
