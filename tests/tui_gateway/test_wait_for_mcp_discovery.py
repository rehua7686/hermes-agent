"""Tests for shared MCP startup wait handling (PR #35245).

MCP tool discovery runs in a background daemon thread so a slow/dead server
can't freeze ``gateway.ready``.  The agent snapshots its tool list once at
build time and never re-reads it, so ``_make_agent`` briefly joins the
discovery thread before building — bounded, so a dead server can't re-introduce
the startup hang, and a no-op once discovery has finished.
