"""Regression tests for the gateway cron-ticker watchdog (#32612).

Before this fix the ticker thread silently died if ``cron.scheduler.tick``
raised — the error was logged at DEBUG (invisible at the default INFO
level) and a ``BaseException`` would tear the thread down entirely. The
operator had no way of knowing because ``hermes cron status`` only
checked whether the gateway *process* was alive, not whether the ticker
thread was still ticking.

The fix:
- Promotes per-tick exception logging to WARNING with a traceback.
- Wraps the tick body in an outer ``except BaseException`` so a transient
  fault cannot permanently kill the thread.
- Writes a heartbeat after every tick.
- ``hermes cron status`` reads that heartbeat and reports the ticker as
  dead when it stops being refreshed.
