"""Shared threat-pattern library for context window security scanning.

This module is the single source of truth for prompt-injection / promptware /
exfiltration patterns used across the context-assembly scanners
(``agent/prompt_builder.py``, ``tools/memory_tool.py``) and the tool-result
delimiter system in ``agent/tool_dispatch_helpers.py``.

Pattern philosophy
------------------
Patterns are organized by ATTACK CLASS, not by source file.  Each pattern
is a ``(regex, pattern_id, scope)`` tuple, where ``scope`` controls which
scanners use it:

- ``"all"``  — applied everywhere (classic prompt injection, exfiltration)
- ``"context"`` — applied to context files + memory + tool results
  (promptware / C2 / behavioral hijack; broader detection)
- ``"strict"`` — applied to memory writes + skill installs only
  (aggressive checks acceptable for user-curated content but too noisy
  for tool results)

The split exists because tool results contain web pages, GitHub issues,
and MCP responses — content the user did not author — and we want broad
detection there, but blocking is reserved for paths where the user can
intervene (memory writes, skill installs).

Pattern anchoring
-----------------
New patterns anchor on **C2-specific vocabulary or unambiguous attack
behavior**, NOT on bossy English.  Phrases like "you are obligated to"
or "you must" alone are too common in legitimate instruction-writing
(see AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, etc.) to flag.  See the pattern comments for
the rationale on borderline cases.

Multi-word bypass
-----------------
Patterns use ``(?:\\w+\\s+)*`` between key tokens to prevent attackers
from inserting filler words (e.g. "ignore all prior instructions" instead
of "ignore all instructions").  This mirrors the fix applied to
``skills_guard.py`` in commit 4ea29978.
